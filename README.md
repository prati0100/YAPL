# Luac

A compiler for a lua-like language written for my compilers class. It does NOT compile lua. Rather, a language with the grammar inspired from lua.

The grammar is taken from the [Lua Manual](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html).

I will add more details later as the project progresses.
